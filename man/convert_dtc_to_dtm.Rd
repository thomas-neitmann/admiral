\title{Convert a Date Character Vector into a Datetime Object}
\usage{
convert_dtc_to_dtm(
  dtc,
  date_imputation = NULL,
  time_imputation = "00:00:00",
  min_dates = NULL,
  max_dates = NULL,
  preserve = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtc}{The \code{'--DTC'} date to convert.

A character date is expected in a format like \code{yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss}.
A partial datetime will issue a warning.
Note: you can use \code{\link[=impute_dtc]{impute_dtc()}} function to build a complete datetime.}

\item{date_imputation}{The value to impute the day/month when a datepart is
missing.

If \code{NULL}: no date imputation is performed and partial dates are returned as
missing.

Otherwise, a character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with month and day specified as \code{"mm-dd"}: e.g. \code{"06-15"} for the 15th
of June,
\item or as a keyword: \code{"first"}, \code{"mid"}, \code{"last"} to impute to the first/mid/last
day/month.
}

Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{time_imputation}{The value to impute the time when a timepart is
missing.

A character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with hour, min and sec specified as \code{"hh:mm:ss"}: e.g. \code{"00:00:00"}
for the start of the day,
\item or as a keyword: \code{"first"},\code{"last"} to impute to the start/end of a day.
}

Default is \code{"00:00:00"}.}

\item{min_dates}{Minimum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not
before any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed adverse event start
date is not before the first treatment date. Only dates which are in the
range of possible dates of the \code{dtc} value are considered. The possible dates
are defined by the missing parts of the \code{dtc} date (see example below). This
ensures that the non-missing parts of the \code{dtc} date are not changed.
A date or date-time object is expected.
For example

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{impute_dtc(
"2020-11",
min_dates = list(
 ymd_hms("2020-12-06T12:12:12"),
 ymd_hms("2020-11-11T11:11:11")
),
date_imputation = "first"
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

returns \code{"2020-11-11T11:11:11"} because the possible dates for \code{"2020-11"}
range from \code{"2020-11-01T00:00:00"} to \code{"2020-11-30T23:59:59"}. Therefore
\code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} is ignored. Returning \code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} would
have changed the month although it is not missing (in the \code{dtc} date).}

\item{max_dates}{Maximum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not after
any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed date is not after the data
cut off date. Only dates which are in the range of possible dates are
considered. A date or date-time object is expected.}

\item{preserve}{Preserve day if month is missing and day is present

For example \code{"2019---07"} would return \verb{"2019-06-07} if \code{preserve = TRUE}
(and \code{date_imputation = "MID"}).

Permitted Values: \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}

Default: \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A datetime object
}
\description{
Convert a date character vector (usually \code{'--DTC'}) into a Date vector (usually \code{'--DTM'}).
}
\details{
Usually this computation function can not be used with \verb{\%>\%}.
